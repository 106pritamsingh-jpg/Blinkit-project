-- 1. DATABASE AND TABLE SETUP
-- =====================================================================

-- Creates the database 'blinkit' if it doesn't already exist.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS blinkit;

-- Sets the newly created database as the one to use for the following commands.
USE blinkit;

-- Drops the table 'items' if it exists, to start fresh.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS items;

-- Creates the 'items' table to store the sales data.
CREATE TABLE items (
    Item_Fat_Content VARCHAR(50),
    Item_Identifier VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    Item_Type VARCHAR(50),
    Outlet_Establishment_Year INT,
    Outlet_Identifier VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
